### [EcoChess (Available on Itch.io)](https://ivo-the-hedgehog.itch.io/ecochess)

Openworld chess, in a nutshell. each animal/person represents a chess piece. It was developed using Unity's DOTS+Burst compiler and, for the AI, it uses the Alpha Beta Prunning algorithm, an evolution of the Minimax algorithm. You can also use spells to affect the enemy/ terrain, such as petrifying an enemy piece or invoking a snowstorm.

In Elderand I was responsible for developing the AI of the enemies using Behaviour Trees/FSMs through the NodeCanvas asset. I was also responsible for all the audio integration with the project, such as mixing/treating audio and even creating some very few sounds for the game.
